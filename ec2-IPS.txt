public Ipaddress : Ec2 instance to login and application given to enduser.

it is visible in AWS console dash board only..

Ec2 instance ==>>> stop and start ==>> public Ipaddress will automatically changed ==>> because it is dynamic.

public ip is dynamic ==>>> application ==>> not going to EU..==>> business impact ..

To over come this ==>> ELAstic IPaddress..


private IPaddress : It is used to internal communication.

it is visible in AWS console dash board and ec2 instance.

Ec2 instance ==>>> stop and start ==>> private Ipaddress will not be changed ==>> because it is static.
